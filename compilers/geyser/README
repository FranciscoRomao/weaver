ABOUT

Code and Dataset for "Geyser: A Compilation Framework for Quantum Computing with Neutral Atoms" (ISCA'22)

INSTRUCTIONS

The 'code' directory contains all of the source code.

The 'qasm' directory contains the 'original' QASM files of the algorithms used in the paper (they have the suffix '_original'). The new QASM files after running the code will also be generated in this directory.

Running 'simulate_algorithm.py' will run all the algorithms in the paper. It will run 'map_circuit.py' and generate the QASM of the mapped circuit in the 'qasm' directory with the suffix '_mapped'. Then, it will run 'block_circuit.py' and generate the QASM of the blocked circuit in the 'qasm' directory with the suffix '_blocked'. Finally, it will run 'compose_circuit.py' and generate the QASM of the final composed circuit in the 'qasm' directory with the suffix '_composed'.
